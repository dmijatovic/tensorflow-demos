# Tensorflow with NodeJS

**It seems that I cannot install tfjs-node library on my shared (samba) drives mounted using fdisk. Therefore is this example places in documents folder of local drive**

Open the project on myPC2016 ./dusan/Documents/test-tfjs-node-gpu

Unfortunatelly I have not managed to have CUDA gpu setup working. The graphics gard is properly registered and CUDA drivers are present.
