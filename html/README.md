# Tensorflow

This folder holds samples from the [Udemy training Machine learning in JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-in-javascript-with-tensorflow-js/)

There is also a [repo with all solution from this training](https://github.com/tech-courses/tensorflowjs-course-solutions/tree/master/Sections)

I just downloaded ones that I wanted to study in more details. The ideas and the approach from this training are used in nuxt demo.
